# Re:Dream

A procedurally generated platforming-roguelike in 3D

This project uses the following assets from Asset Store:

* [Starter Assets - Third Person Character Controller](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-character-controller-196526) by Unity Technologies.

For the imported prefabs to work correctly, please make sure to license the above packages and install them into the project. When prompted, install any additonal dependencies. Once everything's installed, move the new folders to the following paths:

`Assets/_Imports/StarterAssets`  

Similarily, you'll need to install TMP Essentials via Window > Text Mesh Pro and click "Import TMP Essential Resources". With the "TextMesh Pro" folder it generates, place the folder here:

`Assets/_Imports/TextMesh Pro`

Finally, the project was built using:

* ProBuilder - installed via Unity Registry  
* ProGrids - installed via Git `com.unity.progrids`  

These resources should already be in the project.


## Known Issues

If the player controller appears pink, please check the three materials on Player/Armature_Mesh. Each of them should be set to Standard.
