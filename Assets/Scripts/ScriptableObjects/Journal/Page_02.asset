  pageContent: As I made my way towards the exit, I couldn't help but feel relieved.
    But that relief was short-lived. The path ahead was blocked, and I realized I
    needed another puzzle piece to unlock the exit. Frustrated, I searched the area,
    but nothing was in sight. That's when I remembered the shadows I defeated earlier.
    I looked back and noticed something sparkling. It was the puzzle piece I needed.
    The dream was telling me that sometimes, the solution to our problems is behind
    us, hidden in our past struggles. It was a reminder to reflect on my past challenges
    and use those experiences to overcome my current obstacles.
