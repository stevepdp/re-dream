  pageContent: 'I leaped from cloud to cloud until I found myself in another challenge
    space. This time, I couldn''t use my mindset skills to fight back. Instead, I
    had to dodge the phantoms that kept spawning. With every near-miss, I felt myself
    getting better at predicting their movements. Eventually, the phantoms disappeared,
    leaving a puzzle piece as a reward. I realized that sometimes, the only way to
    succeed is to focus on what I can control and stay calm under pressure. '
