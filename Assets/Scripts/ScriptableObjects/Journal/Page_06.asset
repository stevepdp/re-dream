  pageContent: 'As I leapt from platform to platform, ascending the rocky face ever
    higher, I couldn''t shake the feeling that I was being watched. It was as if
    the nightmares I had defeated were lingering, waiting for their chance to strike
    again. As I turned to look back, I saw it: the faint glimmer of another puzzle
    piece. It was almost as if the dream itself was guiding me, urging me to keep
    going. I pressed on, jumping ever higher until I reached the platform holding
    the puzzle piece. I picked it up, feeling a rush of satisfaction and excitement.
    With each piece, I was one step closer to understanding the true purpose of this
    dream. '
