  pageContent: I reached the challenge space, and my heart sank. Demons surrounded
    me, reminding me of all the negative influences in my life. But I knew how to
    defeat them, and I focused on my powers. I moved quickly, leaping across the
    disappearing platforms to avoid their attacks. With each shot of my powers, I
    felt a weight lift from my shoulders. The timer ticked down, and as demons vanished,
    I realized that I had conquered some inner demons as well. The puzzle piece glowed
    before me, and as I collected it, I felt renewed and empowered.
