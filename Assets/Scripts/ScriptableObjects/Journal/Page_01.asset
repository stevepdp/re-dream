  pageContent: As I descend into the cave, a sense of foreboding weighs heavy on
    my heart. I can feel the shadows of my doubts and fears closing in around me.
    But I am not defenseless. With a focused mind, I am able to blast away the shadows
    and emerge victorious.<br><br>With each puzzle piece I find, a new section of
    my journal opens up, revealing more about the dream that has plagued me for so
    long.
