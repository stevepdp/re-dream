  pageContent: As I reached the next puzzle piece, I couldn't help but reflect on
    the challenges that I have faced up to this point. Losing my powers had been
    a humbling experience. It reminded me that no matter how skilled or powerful
    I thought I was, I was still vulnerable to the unknown. But then I remembered
    something else. I still had my resilience, my determination, and my ability to
    adapt. These were my true strengths, and they couldn't be taken away from me.
    With a renewed sense of confidence, I reached out and collected the puzzle piece,
    ready for whatever challenges lay ahead.
